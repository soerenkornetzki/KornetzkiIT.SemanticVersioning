Security Policy
===============

*This is a new project, and the actual security policy is currently in the
making.*


Reporting a Vulnerability
-------------------------

Please send vulnerability reports to [security@kornetzkiit.com][1].

You can expect a first response within 3 hours (Monday to Sunday, 08:00 - 20:00
UTC+0100).

Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, it may take from 2 days up to 2
weeks until your reported vulnerability has been fixed in source code.

In most cases, you will recieve an update to verify that it also fixes the
vulnerability you have discovered on your system configuration.

After we and you have verified that the fix has successfully mitigated the
vulnerability, and does not raised further bugs or vulnerabilities, the update
will be published for regular customers to download within the critical update
channel.

We do **not** offer payment in any way (blackmail, gratitude, etc.). We respect
our customers privacy, data, and safety, and try our best in securing our
products. And your finding possibly are a result of training and/or material you
have obtain free-of-charge (e.g. by the security community). If we would pay
anything, why should it only being you who is payed, and not the people that
helped you (with knowledge and tooling). Because this is an endless pit, we
decided to not pay anything.

If you would like to be mentioned free of charge in the security builitin,
update description, and changelog, please as us to do this  explicitly. We can
mention your nicname, real name, and/or company, but will not include any
details unless you ask for it.
